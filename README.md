# reuters_crawler
This repo is an implementation of crawler to fetch news from reuters website

In order to implement the crawler, I refer to this website: https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43458499/article/details/104693499

However, this code cannot fetch the content correctly, I use goose3 to replace this module.
